# MakerBot Typer Project
This Project's goal was to use what was once a Makerbot 3D printer and reprogram it to do something else entirely. Our goal was to connect it with two keyboards and have it read so that whenever something was typed on one keyboard it would type it faster on the other. The problem this solved was helping Zack type faster on an online typing test.

## Starting Off
We started off this project with an old makerbot replicator 3D printer. After removing most of the unnecessary parts we began researching how it works.
### Stepper Problems
Our original plan was to use the motors that were already in the MakerBot. however these motors were not compatible with the H bridges the engineering lab provided. They were technically compatible however with the H bridges in the Makerbot. We spent a good deal of time trying to figure out how they work. Due to another engineering student (Graham) frying them we ended up removing the steppers entirely and replacing them with ones that were compatible with the H bridges in the lab. We also took apart some more of the MakerBot and removed the Steppers it came with, replacing them with the Steppers the lab provided. The stepper size was NEMA-17.
### Typing Arm
We also ran into a problem with changing the arm already on the printer due to it not being designed for typing. We ended up removing a large portion of it and replacing it with a 3D part and a servo that would be used as an arm to punch the keys. This initially did not work as the arm came in at an angle that did not press the keys right. So I designed an arm that came in at a better angle.
